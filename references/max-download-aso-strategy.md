# Max-Download ASO Strategy (Policy-Safe)

## Objective

Maximize first-time installs while protecting listing health and long-term ranking.

## Strategy Stack

1. Foundation hygiene
- Metadata clarity
- Policy compliance
- Rating/review integrity
- Crash and quality baseline

2. Intent architecture
- Split demand into intent clusters
- Map cluster to listing message hierarchy
- Build custom page/listing variants per cluster

3. Creative conversion loop
- Test icon and first screenshot narrative
- Match value proposition to user intent stage
- Keep one-variable-change experiments where possible

4. Localization loop
- Prioritize high potential locales by TAM and conversion gap
- Adapt copy and screenshots to local context, not only translation

5. Experiment operating model
- Weekly backlog refresh
- ICE scoring for test priority
- Stop/scale decisions by predefined thresholds

6. Retention-aware ASO
- Track install quality, not only raw installs
- Include early retention signal in experiment evaluation

## Recommended Metrics

- Listing conversion rate (visitor -> installer)
- Retained first-time installer rate
- Uninstall rate (early window)
- Rating velocity and sentiment trend
- Organic keyword coverage and share of branded/non-branded installs

## 30/60 Day Pattern

- Days 1-15: compliance cleanup + metadata baseline
- Days 16-30: first experiment wave + localization setup
- Days 31-45: scale winning creatives and clusters
- Days 46-60: second experiment wave + retention optimization pass

## Execution Rule

Never ship a growth tactic without attaching:

- Policy check result
- Hypothesis
- Metric target
- Rollback condition
