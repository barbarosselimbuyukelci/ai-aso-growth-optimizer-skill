# Abuse Patterns And Enforcement Risks

## Why This File Exists

ASO teams often copy short-term tactics without modeling policy risk. This file maps common abuse patterns to likely enforcement outcomes.

## High-Risk Abuse Patterns

1. Fake installs and install farms
2. Fake or incentivized reviews and ratings
3. Misleading screenshots or claims for features not in product
4. Competitor trademark stuffing in title/keyword fields
5. Repetitive or irrelevant keyword spam
6. Deceptive ad flows that coerce install actions
7. Clone-app flooding and low-value duplicate listings

## Typical Outcome Patterns

- Metadata rejection or forced metadata rewrite
- Ranking suppression and discoverability loss
- Listing takedown or account-level enforcement
- Loss of user trust and conversion decay

## Safe Alternative Strategy

For each risky tactic, replace with a compliant growth mechanism:

- Fake social proof -> authentic review generation loops after positive in-app milestones
- Keyword stuffing -> intent-clustered metadata with clean relevance
- Deceptive claims -> proof-backed value statements and product-true creatives
- Forced install traffic -> intent-matched ads landing on custom store pages

## Use In Runs

This file should be used to annotate every proposed ASO action with:

- Risk level (low/medium/high)
- Relevant policy source
- Safe replacement option
